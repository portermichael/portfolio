    "articleContent": "<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p><p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

    "articleContent": "<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p><p>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.<p> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."

    "articleContent": "<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</p><p>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<p> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32."

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.<p> It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

    "articleContent": "<p>When I first started developing I did not see the point in a blog. But, when I started learning beyond the basics and troubleshooting through google, or checking out alternative techniques, I often ran into blogs for potential solutions and thought pieces. Most of the time, I was not receiving an expansive guide, or a lot of code, but they were almost always a great starting point.  A technical blog I often ran into in my early days was joshsoftware.com</p>
    <p>Even after running into technical blogs I figured these were just folks with years of experience; a blog is for someone in their fifth year programming who wants to give back to the community. Why should I extend the extra effort while I am still learning? Could I even put out anything decent? There are already posts on polymorphic associates and guides, why would it be helpful if I wrote one?</p>
    <h4>Professional Uses</h4>
    <p>When I started exploring software positions, I began seeing preferences towards individuals with personal websites and blogs. Obviously an employer wants overachievers. Software posts often call for folks who enjoy programming in their offtime. We should maintain a good work life balance, but a great employee is involved in their work and does thinks about their field in their time off.</p>
    <p>A blog can also be a....</p>
    <h4>Good Skills Measuring Stick</h4>
    <p>A technical blog demonstrates a certain level of technical competence. If we start early enough and consistently a techincal blog can be an accurate measuring stick of skills. A sort of checkbox of abilities.</p>
    <p>It is true what they say. You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to someone else. So get out there and write posts on the concepts you already know, or even write out the concepts you do not know to find your faults. Worst case scenario, if you want to review something, you can fall back on your own personal body of work and see it again in your own words.</p>
    <p>Everyone with a technical blog is just like you and me. They took the intiative at some point, and their skills grew with them to the extent that now we can all use their posts and a resource for our own growth.</p>"
